SudokuSolver
============

This project was written to solve Sudoku puzzles following the same process a human would.  There are undoubtedly more efficient means of getting a solution, but I wanted to create something that would be more understandable, while still being fairly efficient.  I believe this project does that, but could probably stand to be refactored to adhere to accepted design patterns.  I will also try to port it to Java and other languages.
